About The Project

A MongoDB API for accessing information about in season crops for the farming sim Coral Island. Crop information retrieved from the Coral Island wiki.

Crop information is divided by the season and you can access the following:

    Crop type
    Seed name & cost
    Growing time & regrowth time (if applicable)

Future Improvements Planned:

    Crop Planner that will allow you to make a shopping list of seeds by searching through crops by season
    Crop Tracker that will keep track of plots and growth phase
